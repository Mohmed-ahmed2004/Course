          The pawn is the most numerous and weakest chess piece. It moves one
          square forward, two squares on its first move, and captures
          diagonally. Pawns cannot move backward. When a pawn reaches the
          opposite end of the board, it promotes to a queen, rook, bishop, or
          knight. Pawns play a crucial role in controlling the center of the
          board and attacking opponents.

        </div>
        <div class="explain">
          The queen is the most powerful piece in chess, combining the moves of
          a rook and a bishop. It can move any number of squares in a straight
          line, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each player starts with
          one queen, placed next to their king. Due to its strength, a pawn is
          often promoted to a queen when it reaches the opposite end of the
          board. The queen is crucial for attacking, defending, and controlling
          the board.

        </div>
        <div class="explain">
          The rook is a powerful chess piece that moves in a straight line,
          either horizontally or vertically, as far as it wants until it reaches
          the edge of the board or is blocked by another piece. It can capture
          any enemy piece it lands on. Rooks are particularly strong in open
          positions where they can control long files and ranks. They are often
          used in conjunction with the queen to create powerful attacks. In the
          endgame, rooks become even more valuable as they can easily coordinate
          with pawns to deliver checkmate.

        </div>
        <div class="explain">
          The knight is a unique chess piece that moves in an "L" shape. It
          moves two squares in one direction and then one square in a
          perpendicular direction. This allows it to jump over other pieces,
          making it a versatile and powerful piece. Knights are often used to
          control the center of the board and to attack opponents' pieces from
          unexpected angles. They are also valuable for their ability to fork
          opponents' pieces, which means attacking two pieces at once.

      <div class="bishop">

        </div>
        <div class="explain">
          The bishop is a chess piece that moves diagonally. Each player starts
          with two bishops, one on a light square and one on a dark square.
          Bishops can move any number of squares along a diagonal, but they
          cannot jump over other pieces. They are valuable pieces that can
          control many squares on the board, especially in open positions.
          Bishops are often considered to be more powerful than knights, but
          they are less valuable than rooks or queens.

        <div class="king-image">
          <img src="images/king.png" alt="king" title="king" />
        </div>
        <div class="explain">
          The king is the most important piece in chess. It moves one square in
          any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The goal of
          the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning it's under
          attack and cannot escape. A king in check must be defended
          immediately. Castling is a special move where the king and a rook move
          together for protection. The endgame often revolves around king
          activity, as it becomes a powerful piece in maneuvering pawns and
          capturing pieces.
